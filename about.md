Hi! I'm Yuval; currently (2016) I'm a second-year MBA Candidate at the Harvard Business School.

This website was mostly created to document my efforts as I go through the class [How to Make (almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/) to which I am cross-registered at MIT. 
I also work with [ClimaCell](http://www.climacell.co) on weather forecasting.
