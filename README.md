# Yuval's HTMAA site
This website was mostly created to document my efforts as I go through the class [How to Make (almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/) to which I am cross-registered at MIT. 
This site is based on Barry Clark's [Build a Blog with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
See the first post about Website Steup for more details.
