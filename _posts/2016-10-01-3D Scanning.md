title: Week Three&#58; 3D Scanning

See my face in 3D.

### Sense

For the assignment (scan anything) I worked together with [Miki Vizner](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/section.Harvard/people/Vizner/index.html) - after all, it's a two man job to both sit and scan yourself with the camera. We played around with [Sense](http://www.3dsystems.com/shop/sense) - a fairly easy-to-use 3d scanner. Here's what we found out during our many attempts to get a good results:

* The camera has to be held fairly stable, at about 12-15" distance from what we are trying to measure.
* the speed in which we move around the object should be slow, but not too slow - move too fast and there will be "spots" in the image, move too slow and the camera may lose its 'lock' on the image.
* Some 'white' spots can not be avoided; in this case, the Sense driver has a mechanism that will smoothen those out with extrapolation algorithms. This worked great on my face, but the glasses (as you observable below) did not come out as well as we had hoped.

The end result is pretty cool - the camera scanned my face and also the different colors. Here it is:

<div class='modelo-wrapper'> <iframe src="https://beta.modelo.io/embedded/UNwm_mygmb?viewport=false&autoplay=false" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen ></iframe> <p style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0; color: #666666;"> My Face <a href="http://www.modelo.io?utm_source=embed&utm_medium=embedfooter&utm_campaign=model%20embed%20footer" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 6px; padding-left: 6px; border-left: 1px solid #e2e2e2; color: #e8776f; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">Modelo Â»</a> </p> </div>

The source file is available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/project_files/Yuval1.3dm). This is actually a Rhino converted file (3dm). When I tried to use the .stl file that was created by Sense, Modelo seemed to lose the right color scheme and I looked odd.
